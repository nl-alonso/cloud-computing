## Files Ready:
- **`sample_data.csv`** - 50 Accounts

## Quick Test:

After import, test your voice app with:
- **"Show me all accounts"** - should return ~50 accounts
- **"Find opportunities over 100k"** - should return multiple opportunities
- **"Show me technology companies"** - should return tech accounts
- **"Find contacts at TechCorp"** - should return contacts

## Already Working!

I see from your recent logs that you already have data working:
```
INFO:__main__:Query successful: 32 records
```

Your voice query for opportunities over $100k already returned 32 records! ðŸŽ‰

## Voice Query Examples:
- "Show me my biggest opportunities"
- "Find accounts in the technology industry" 
- "Show me contacts who are CEOs"
- "What deals are closing this month?"
- "Find prospects in healthcare"

Total records after import: **~150+ records** to make your voice queries much more interesting!
